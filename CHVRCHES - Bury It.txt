[Verse 1]
Cover up, cover up, cover up that you're ruthless
Nobody, nobody, nobody's ever gonna notice
And I am catchin' up and I am seein' red
How about I prove I'm right and raise it overhead?

[Pre-Chorus]
I never promised you anything I couldn't do
We tried to bury it and rise above, bury it and rise above
You, you, you never promised me you were seeing differently
Bury it and rise above, bury it and rise above

[Chorus]
You, you
You bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above
You bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above

[Verse 2]
Reaching, reaching for, reaching for my resistance
Nobody, nobody, nobody sees it at a distance
And I am catchin' up and I am seein' red
How about I throw my way and raise it overhead?

[Pre-Chorus]
I never promised you anything I couldn't do
We tried to bury it and rise above, bury it and rise above
You, you, you never promised me you were seeing differently
Bury it and rise above, bury it and rise above

[Chorus - Extended]
You, you
You bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above
You bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above
You bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above
You bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above

[Pre-Chorus]
I never promised you anything I couldn't do
We tried to bury it and rise above, bury it and rise above
You, you, you never promised me you were seeing differently
Bury it and rise above, bury it and rise above

[Chorus - Extended]
You, you
You bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above
You bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above
You bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above
You bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above
